# PowerBI-ScatterMatrix

![ScatterMatrix](https://i.imgur.com/acDeRMs.png)

This custom Power BI visual adds a scatterplot matrix with density functions and distributions. It is built in R and relies on the ggAlly package. The script uses some workarounds with ggpairs to allow for custom color support. Support for different colors and categorical variables will be added.
